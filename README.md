# Mail logger Fano Framework web application demo

Example Fano Framework web application to demonstrates how to write log to email address in background thread.

This project is generated using [Fano CLI](https://github.com/fanoframework/fano-cli)
command line tools to help scaffolding web application using Fano Framework.

## Requirement

- Linux or FreeBSD
- [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/) >= 3.0
- Web Server ([Apache with mod_proxy_scgi](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy_scgi.html), nginx)
- [Fano CLI](https://github.com/fanoframework/fano-cli)
- Web Server (Apache, nginx)
- Administrative privilege for setting up virtual host

## Installation

### TLDR
Make sure all requirements are met. Run
```
$ git clone https://github.com/fanoframework/fano-logger-mail.git --recursive
$ cd fano-logger-mail
$ ./tools/config.setup.sh
$ ./build.sh
$ sudo fanocli --deploy-scgi=mailer-logger.fano
$ ./bin/app.cgi
```
Open internet browser and go to `http://mailer-logger.fano`. You should see application.

On FreeBSD, before running `build.sh`, replace `Tlinux` with `Tfreebsd` in `build.cfg`.

### Setup SMTP server credential

Edit `config/config.json` and replace `mailer` key with credential of SMTP server. For our example we use mailtrap.io to allow sending fake email without afraid become spammer.

### Build for different environment

To build for different environment, set `BUILD_TYPE` environment variable.

#### Build for production environment

    $ BUILD_TYPE=prod ./build.sh

Build process will use compiler configuration defined in `vendor/fano/fano.cfg`, `build.cfg` and `build.prod.cfg`. By default, `build.prod.cfg` contains some compiler switches that will aggressively optimize executable both in speed and size.

#### Build for development environment

    $ BUILD_TYPE=dev ./build.sh

Build process will use compiler configuration defined in `vendor/fano/fano.cfg`, `build.cfg` and `build.dev.cfg`.

If `BUILD_TYPE` environment variable is not set, production environment will be assumed.

## Change executable output directory

Compilation will output executable to directory defined in `EXEC_OUTPUT_DIR`
environment variable. By default is `public` directory.

    $ EXEC_OUTPUT_DIR=/path/to/public/dir ./build.sh

## Change executable name

Compilation will use executable filename as defined in `EXEC_OUTPUT_NAME`
environment variable. By default is `app.cgi` filename.

    $ EXEC_OUTPUT_NAME=index.cgi ./build.sh

## Run

### Run with a webserver

Setup a virtual host. Please consult documentation of web server you use.

#### Apache

You need to have `mod_proxy_scgi` installed and loaded. This module is Apache's built-in module, so it is very likely that you will have it with your Apache installation. You just need to make sure it is loaded. For example, on Debian,

```
$ sudo a2enmod proxy_scgi
$ sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Create virtual host config and add `ProxyPassMatch`, for example

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
     ServerName www.example.com
     DocumentRoot /home/example/public

     <Directory "/home/example/public">
         Options +ExecCGI
         AllowOverride FileInfo
         Require all granted
     </Directory>

    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPass /css !
    ProxyPass /images !
    ProxyPass /js !
    ProxyPassMatch ^/(.*)$ scgi://127.0.0.1:20477
</VirtualHost>
```
Last four line of virtual host configurations basically tell Apache to serve any
files inside `css`, `images`, `js` directly otherwise pass it to our application.

On Debian, save it to `/etc/apache2/sites-available` for example as `fano-scgi.conf`
Enable this site and restart Apache

```
$ sudo a2ensite fano-scgi.conf
$ sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
## Deployment

You need to deploy only executable binary and any supporting files such as HTML templates, images, css stylesheets, application config.
Any `pas` or `inc` files or shell scripts is not needed in deployment machine in order application to run.

So for this repository, you will need to copy `public`, `Templates`, `config`
and `storages` directories to your deployment machine. make sure that
`storages` directory is writable by web server.

## Known Issues

### Issue with GNU Linker

When running `build.sh` script, you may encounter following warning:

```
/usr/bin/ld: warning: public/link.res contains output sections; did you forget -T?
```

This is known issue between Free Pascal and GNU Linker. See
[FAQ: link.res syntax error, or "did you forget -T?"](https://www.freepascal.org/faq.var#unix-ld219)

However, this warning is minor and can be ignored. It does not affect output executable.

### Issue with unsynchronized compiled unit with unit source

Sometime Free Pascal can not compile your code because, for example, you deleted a
unit source code (.pas) but old generated unit (.ppu, .o, .a files) still there
or when you switch between git branches. Solution is to remove those files.

By default, generated compiled units are in `bin/unit` directory.
But do not delete `README.md` file inside this directory, as it is not being ignored by git.

```
$ rm bin/unit/*.ppu
$ rm bin/unit/*.o
$ rm bin/unit/*.rsj
$ rm bin/unit/*.a
```

Following shell command will remove all files inside `bin/unit` directory except
`README.md` file.

    $ find bin/unit ! -name 'README.md' -type f -exec rm -f {} +

`tools/clean.sh` script is provided to simplify this task.

### Windows user

Free Pascal supports Windows as target operating system, however, this repository is not yet tested on Windows. To target Windows, in `build.cfg` replace
compiler switch `-Tlinux` with `-Twin64` and uncomment line `#-WC` to
become `-WC`.

### Lazarus user

While you can use Lazarus IDE, it is not mandatory tool. Any text editor for code editing (Atom, Visual Studio Code, Sublime, Vim etc) should suffice.
